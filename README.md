## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 (custom properties, Flexbox)
- Responsive design principles
- Font integration using `@font-face`
- Visual enhancements (box-shadow, hover effects)

### What I Learned

- How to center elements using Flexbox
- How to apply custom fonts using `@font-face`
- How to create dense, modern shadows with `box-shadow`
- How to structure a clean, responsive layout using mobile-first design

```css
#main {
  box-shadow: 0 15px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

```html
@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyCustomFont';
  src: url('./assets/fonts/my-font.woff2') format('woff2');
}
```

### Continued Development

- Improve accessibility with better focus indicators
- Add animation on hover for smoother transitions
- Explore using CSS Grid for more complex layouts
- Build a reusable card component in React

### Useful Resources
